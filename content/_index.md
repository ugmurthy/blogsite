{{< style "text-align:center; outline:1px solid black;border-radius: 4px ; strong{color:#ffb100;}" >}}

This content comes from `/content/_index.md` having `class` and `id` as `content`. Note the title does not appear on the home page and if we need to style this differently then we can use extended shortcode `style` provided by the **LoveIt theme**

{{< /style >}}
