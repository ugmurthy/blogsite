<p>Prompt : <em>I am looking for software that manager a blogsite whose content can be stored as MarkDown on Github. It should basic blogsite features that as chronologically ordered posts, search, tagging for categorisation.</em></p>
<h2 id="key-points">Key Points</h2>
<ul>
<li>It seems likely that Hugo is a suitable software for managing a blog site with Markdown content stored on GitHub, offering features like chronologically ordered posts, search, and tagging.</li>
<li>Research suggests Jekyll is another viable option, with a larger community but potentially slower performance compared to Hugo.</li>
<li>The evidence leans toward using static site generators like Hugo or Jekyll, as they integrate well with GitHub Pages for hosting.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="software-recommendation">Software Recommendation</h2>
<p>For managing your blog site with content stored as Markdown on GitHub, Hugo is a strong choice. Itâ€™s a fast and efficient static site generator that supports Markdown files, allowing you to store your posts in a GitHub repository and generate a blog site with features like chronologically ordered posts, search, and tagging.
